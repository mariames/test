Dear Benjamin,

I was so excited after reading your profile because I saw you like dancing and you speak Spanish! 
Those are some of my biggest passions so I felt good vibes from you right away!

I come from Serbia, on 21th March I have a bus to Prague. 
If you could host me for a couple of nights (whatever number suits you) somewhere between the 21-27 it would be perfect :-)


The reason why I am coming is the dance festival in Prague - Prague Zouk Congress! I love dancing and it is my passion in life
 - that's why your profile caught my attention in the first place and also your amazing references. During the day I'd be free to spend the time roaming around Prague 
 and I'd be happy if you could join me at least for a walk one day. However, during weekend I'd be out all day because of 
 the workshops so I won't spend much time in your apartment. I am saying this just so you know in advance what to expect and
 what my schedule looks like because it doesn't suit everyone :) 
 
 I am easy-going and cheerful and I would be so grateful if you can host me for a night or few. 
 I would love to learn a bit about Prague as well and definitely practice my Spanish with you, haha :-)
 
 Cheers Marijana

 I am sure your sofa will be comfortable enough! :)
